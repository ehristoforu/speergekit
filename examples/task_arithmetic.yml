# This YAML configuration demonstrates a task arithmetic merge.
# It subtracts the parameters of one model from another, scaled by a coefficient,
# and adds the result to a base model.

# The base model that was finetuned
base_model: "path/to/base_model.pth"
models:
  # The finetuned version of the base model
  - model: "path/to/finetuned_model.pth"
  # The target model to which the task vector will be added
  - model: "path/to/target_model.pth"

merge_method: task_arithmetic

parameters:
  # The coefficient to scale the difference of the models
  scaling_factor: 0.5
